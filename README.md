# Natives in Tech Conf 2019

## Planning the 2019 Natives in Tech Conference

f'as@^ (good evening) - This document is intended to strategize efforts around the first annual Natives in Tech Conference. Here we can begin to answer some of the big questions around who we would like to see speak, where it should be held, what tools we should use to organize and communicate. If you have an idea, please open an issue under the issues tab above. Be as descriptive as possible about the issue and how you or others can actively work to complete the task. These ideas will be debated and a constructuve dialogue will lead to what I hope to be the most ideal solution. Let's begin!
